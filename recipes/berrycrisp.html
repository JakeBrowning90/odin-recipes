    <h1>Blackberry Crisp</h1>
    <img src="../img/blackberrycrisp.jpg" alt="Blackberry crisp">
    <h2>Fresh, tart blackberries lightly sweetened and finished with a crispy topping.</h2>
    <p>This dessert is great for evenings in late summer, especially if you have wild blackberries growing nearby. You may even have enough for a steady supply, or freeze extra to use in the winter!</p>
    <p>Feel free to swap some of the blackberries with different fruits, like diced apples or pears, and other kinds of berries.</p>
